    <h3 class="about-summary-work">When I started learning software development, I felt like I was fulfilling a long-awaited dream. Both problem-solving and technology have fascinated me since childhood, so combining them in my career just felt right. My goal is to help solve the problems people face – big and small – by building software that is effective, intuitive, and user-friendly.</h3>

        <h3 class="about-summary-personal">I also love sports and being active 🏃‍♂️ which helps to counteract extended hours working in front of a computer. If I'm not coding, hanging out with my wife, or relaxing, you'll probably find me playing tennis 🎾 doing yoga 🧘‍♂️ or at the gym 😅 most days of the week.</h3>
